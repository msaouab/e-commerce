## E-Commerce Store
- I developed a dynamic and user-friendly e-commerce store using modern web technologies. Leveraging React with TypeScript, Redux for state management, and the Material-UI library along with Styled-Components for styling, I created an engaging shopping experience. The project features a seamless user interface, responsive design, and efficient product catalog management. Through this project, I showcased my proficiency in front-end development and my ability to create robust and visually appealing web applications.
